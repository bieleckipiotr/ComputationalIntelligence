# Computational Intelligence
here you will find my work in the field of computational intelligence:
1. Multilayer Perceptron:
  * basic implementation of backward propagation of error
  * momentum and gradient normalization methods (momentum / RMSprop)
  * Classification (softmax output function)
  * different activation functions (tanh / sigmoid / linear / ReLu)
  * dealing with overfitting
  * **report** of all the work with conclusions
2. Kohonen self-organizing maps:
  * rectangular net, gaussian and mexican hat activation functions
  * hexagonal net
  * **report**
3. Evolutionary Algorithms
  * Cutting stock problem (given a circle of radius R and a set of rectangles)
  * Optimisation of MLP weights (without MLP learning, pure Evolutionary Algorithm)
  * **report**
